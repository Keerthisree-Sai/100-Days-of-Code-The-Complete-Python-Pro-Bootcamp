- IndexErrors and Working with Nested Lists
## Project Completed
**Rock Paper Scissors – Python Console Game**
This is a fun, interactive Rock Paper Scissors game developed in Python. The player chooses between rock, paper, or scissors, while the computer randomly makes its choice. The game then displays both choices using ASCII art and announces the result.
**Key Highlights**
- Randomized computer move using Python’s random module
- ASCII art to visually represent each move
- Input validation to handle invalid entries
- Clear win/lose/draw logic using conditionals
This project is ideal for beginners to strengthen their understanding of control flow, user input handling, and basic game logic in Python.
